Requirement:
------------
1. LAN-1 Can Access Server-1
2. LAN-2 Can't Access Server-2

Step 1: Define the ACL for Router1
Allow LAN-1 (192.168.100.0/24) to access Server-1 (10.10.10.0/24).
Deny LAN-2 (192.168.200.0/24) access to Server-2 (10.10.20.0/24).
Step 2: Apply ACL Configuration on Router1
Create an ACL (let's use ACL 10).

Permit LAN-1 to access Server-1.
Deny LAN-2 from accessing Server-2.
Allow other traffic as needed.
Apply the ACL to the appropriate interface.

The ACL should be applied to the outbound traffic on the interface leading to Router2 (g0/0/1).
Configuration Commands
Router1: ACL Configuration:

! Create standard ACL for LAN-1 and LAN-2

access-list 10 deny 192.168.200.0 0.0.0.255
access-list 10 permit any

! Apply ACL 10 to the outbound interface towards Router2
interface gig0/0/1
ip access-group 10 out
