1. Set router IP and PC ip with CLI/manually

R1:
LAN-1: ipv4 address and subnet: 192.168.100.1 and 255.255.255.0
LAN-2: ipv4 address and subnet: 192.168.200.1 and 255.255.255.0
R2:
Net-1: ipv4 address and subnet: 10.10.10.1 and 255.255.255.0
Net-2: ipv4 address and subnet: 10.10.20.1 and 255.255.255.0

Interconnected LAN I guess:192.168.50.0/30
R1: se0/1/0 192.168.50.1 255.255.255.252
R2: se0/1/0 192.168.50.2 255.255.255.252
set clock rate same. I did 64000

2. Do routing between router
R1:
ip route 10.10.10.0 255.255.255.0 192.168.50.2
ip route 10.10.20.0 255.255.255.0 192.168.50.2

and R2: 
ip route 192.168.100.0 255.255.255.0 192.168.50.1
ip route 192.168.200.0 255.255.255.0 192.168.50.1

3. check ping of all device
